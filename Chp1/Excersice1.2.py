# Use a web browser to go to the Python website python.org. This page contains
# information about Python and links to Python-related pages, and it gives you
# the ability to search the Python documentation. For example, if you enter
# print in the search window, the first link that appears is the documentation
# of the print statement. At this point, not all of it will make sense to
# you, but it is good to know where it is.
