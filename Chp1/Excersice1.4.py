# Start the Python interpreter and use it as a calculator. Python's syntax
# for math operations is almost the same as standard mathematical notation.
# For example, the symbols +, - and / denote addition, subtraction and
# division, as you would expect. The symbol for multiplication is '*'.

# If you run a 10 kilometer race in 43 minutes 30 seconds, what is your average time
# per mile? What is your average speed in miles per hour? (Hint: there are
# 1.61 kilometers in a mile).

# conevert distance to distance in miles
distance=10*1.61
