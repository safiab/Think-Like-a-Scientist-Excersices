# Exercise 1.1 Write a well-structured English sentence with invalid tokens in it. Then write another
# sentence with all valid tokens but with invalid structure. When you read a sentence in English or 
# a statement in a formal language, you have to figure out what the structure of the sentence is. 
# This process is called parsing.

# Write a well-structured English sentence with invalid tokens in it
# I wrote a progam
# here the invalid token is 'progam'

#write another sentence with all valid tokens but with invalid structure
# I program  wrote
